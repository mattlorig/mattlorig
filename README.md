- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattlorig.  I am a Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington.
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical finance -- especially topics related to decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various DeFi protocols (DEXes, Lending, Yield Aggregators, and tokenomics of these protocols).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to mathematical finance and/or decentralized finance.
